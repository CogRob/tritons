  "body": "## About\r\n\r\nTeam Triton is collection of faculty and students from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) within the [Contextual Robotics Institute](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/contextualrobotics/) formed to compete in [RoboCup@Home](http://www.robocupathome.org/); a league aiming to develop service and assistive robot technology with high relevance for future personal domestic applications.\r\n\r\n## Members\r\n\r\nOur team is compromised of robotics professors and graduate students including:\r\n\r\n* [Dr. Henrik I. Christensen](http://www.hichristensen.net/)\r\n  * Professor of Computer Science at Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering UC San Diego and director of the Institute for Contextual Robotics. Dr. Christensen does research on systems integration, human-robot interaction, mapping and robot vision, with a strong emphasis on \"real problems with real solutions\".\r\n* [Dr. Laurel Riek](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lriek/)\r\n  * Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego. She is a roboticist with interests in human-robot interaction, computer vision, and healthcare engineering, and focuses on designing systems able to sense, respond, and adapt to people.\r\n* [Darren Chan](http://darrenmchan.com/)\r\n  * PhD student in the Robotics, Health, and Communication (RHC) Lab in CSE at the UC San Diego working under the direction of Dr. Laurel Riek. Darren's research explores selective attention for robots, as an approach to allow robots to understand the world more efficiently and more robustly.\r\n* [Tariq Iqbal](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tiqbal/)\r\n  * PhD candidate in the Robotics, Health, and Communication (RHC) Lab in CSE at the UC San Diego working under the direction of Dr. Laurel Riek. Tariq's research interest includes modeling team dynamics and coordination phenomena within human-robot cooperation and designed adaptive non-linear algorithms to sense activity emergence with people in real time.\r\n* [Angelique Taylor](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~amt062/)\r\n  * PhD student in the Robotics, Health, and Communication (RHC) Lab in CSE at the UC San Diego working under the direction of Dr. Laurel Riek. Angelique's research lies in the intersection of computer vision, robotics, and artificial intelligence to design algorithms for robots to learn how to behave in human spaces via social context.\r\n* [Priyam Parashar]()\r\n  * PhD student in the Cognitive Robotics (CogRob) Lab in CSE at the UC San Diego working under the direction of Dr. Henrik Christensen. Priyam's research interest includes human robot integration is mobile navigation and social behavioral learning from human demonstration.\r\n* [Shengye Wang](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~shengye/)\r\n  * PhD student in the Cognitive Robotics (CogRob) Lab in CSE at the UC San Diego working under the direction of Dr. Henrik Christensen. Shengye's research interest includes robotic system architecture, contextual and cognitive autonomy, human-computer interaction, and software engineering.\r\n* [Ruffin White](https://about.me/ruffin)\r\n  * PhD student in the Cognitive Robotics (CogRob) Lab in CSE at the UC San Diego working under the direction of Dr. Henrik Christensen. Ruffin's research interests include long-term autonomy, repeatable/reproducible research, robotic cyber-security, as well as open source robotics.\r\n\r\n## Software\r\n\r\nTeam Triton builds upon a number of past open source software project:\r\n\r\n* [OmniMapper](https://github.com/CognitiveRobotics/omnimapper)\r\n  * OmniMapper is an open source SLAM and mapping library and framework developed by the Cognitive Robotics Lab. The mapping library aims to support a wide array of mapping tasks, ranging from scan matching based pose graphs to 3D feature-based maps annotated with semantic information. It has been designed with modularity in mind, so as to provide solutions to multi-modal mapping problems with any sensors that may be available.\r\n* [Edge Based Tracking library](https://github.com/CognitiveRobotics/object_tracking_2D)\r\n  * EBT is a library of C++ classes that implement edge based object tracking in robotics and vision, using textureless object detection and tracking of the 3D pose. Detection and tracking schemes are coherently integrated in a particle filtering framework on the special Euclidean group, SE(3), in which the visual tracking problem is tackled by maintaining multiple hypotheses of the object pose.\r\n* [SROS](http://discourse.ros.org/t/announcing-sros-security-enhancements-for-ros/536)\r\n  * SROS is a proposed addition to the ROS API and ecosystem to support modern cryptography and security measures, including: over-the-wire cryptography for all data transport, namespaced access control enforcing graph policies/restrictions, and finally process profiles using Linux Security Modules to harden a node’s resource access.\r\n\r\n<body>\r\n<h2 id=\"bibliography\" class=\"unnumbered\">Bibliography</h2>\r\n<div id=\"refs\" class=\"references\">\r\n<div id=\"ref-Althaus\">\r\n<p>Althaus, P., H.
